/*
    This playground simulates the steps for the ReachOut app to pull onLoad data from the back-end database server.

    It needs to pull the list of schools and the grades at each school...
        and also the list of topics to tag user tip submissions, and the code numbers associated with each tag.

    In principle, we're pulling results from the server RDS database in a JSON string.
    Then we parse that data into a dictionary structure used by the app.

    Since there was no back-end server online at the time of writing this code, this playground first defines a simulated database
        consisting of an array of structs.
    Then the playground encodes the struct array into JSON, simulating the response from the RDS server.
    Then the playground parses the JSON back into an array of structs that can be used by the app.

    In theory, most of this code could be transfered into the OnLoadData struct file in the ReachOutAZ Xcode project.
